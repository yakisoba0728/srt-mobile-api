# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-15

- Added bounded, lazy personal and group train-search page iteration while
  preserving the existing single-page search methods.
- Reused the hydrated search form and NetFunnel key across continuation pages,
  with exact cursor validation, progress bounds, and one refresh/retry for only
  a continuation page rejected with `NET000001`.
- Kept the reviewed 20-route read-only boundary unchanged. The pagination
  contract is backed by static SRT 2.0.41 app evidence and offline synthetic
  tests; live continuation remains unverified.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-14

- Prepared the existing installable, typed, read-only SRT mobile API client for
  reproducible internal builds and offline verification.
- Retained the 20-route safety boundary, including the bounded seat-page read;
  mutation operations and physical-seat schemas remain excluded.
