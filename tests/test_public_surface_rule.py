"""The rule that decides what is allowed in the package's top-level ``__all__``.

``__all__`` is the public contract. After 1.0.0 a name in it cannot be removed
without breaking somebody, so the expensive mistake is not "we forgot to export
X" — that is a one-line addition later — but "we exported X and now we own it
forever". Everything here exists to make the second mistake fail in CI rather
than in a release.

The rule, stated once:

* Clients, configuration and sessions are public.
* Every type in the transitive closure of a public client method's annotations
  is public — a caller who receives a value must be able to name its type.
* Errors are public. Consent types are public.
* Domain values a caller passes in, or compares a response against, are public.

and everything else is not: transport-layer constants, internal allowlist and
route tables, the ``parse_*``/``pair_*`` functions the client already calls on
the caller's behalf, the token-generation machinery, and constants already
reachable as a default on a config field.

**"Demote" means deleting the import line AND the ``__all__`` entry**, not one
of them. Delete only the ``__all__`` entry and the attribute stays reachable, so
the demotion is half-done and nothing says so; delete only the import and
``from pkg import *`` binds a name that does not exist. Both halves have been
asserted by hand before, for the handful of names somebody remembered to check —
``test_all_equals_the_import_block`` below makes the symmetry a property of
every name instead.

Nothing here holds a list of exported names. A list of names is the thing that
rots — this repository has already shipped two hand-maintained counts that went
stale. Every check derives its expectation from the source: ``__init__.py``'s
import statements via ``ast``, the client's annotations via
``typing.get_type_hints``, the module each name was defined in via the import
that brought it here. What is hand-written is *policy* — which modules may
export at all, and which non-type constants have earned a place — and policy is
what a human should be made to argue for.

This file is shared with the sibling repository. Everything below the
END-OF-PER-REPOSITORY-BLOCK marker is byte-identical in both; only the block
above it differs.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PER-REPOSITORY BLOCK. The sibling repository's copy of this file differs from
# this one in exactly the constants below and nothing else.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: The distribution's import name.
PACKAGE_NAME = "srt_mobile_api"

#: The client class whose public methods define the reachable type closure.
CLIENT_CLASS_NAME = "SrtClient"

#: Modules whose module-level *functions* may appear in ``__all__``. These are
#: the entry points and the vocabulary a caller uses directly: constructing a
#: client, building a config, naming an error, stating consent. A function
#: exported from anywhere else is, by construction, a step the client already
#: performs for the caller.
#:
#: ``live`` and ``netfunnel`` are on disk here and appear in the sibling
#: repository's list; they are deliberately absent from this one, because this
#: package exports nothing from either. The self-consistency check below is a
#: subset test, so naming a module that exports nothing would not fail — it
#: would just make the list decorative, which is the state this file exists to
#: prevent.
FUNCTION_EXPORTING_MODULES = frozenset(
    {
        "client",
        "config",
        "consent",
        "errors",
    }
)

#: Modules that may export types and domain constants but never a function.
#: These hold request dataclasses, response dataclasses and the coded values
#: the app sends — all things a caller names — beside the builders, encoders
#: and table generators that produce them, which a caller does not.
#:
#: ``models`` is the whole of this package's type vocabulary: 37 exported
#: classes and no exported function. It sits in the stricter bucket for exactly
#: that reason. Every parser and payload builder lives in ``parsers`` and
#: ``payloads``, which are internal, so a function appearing here would mean one
#: of those had been re-exported through ``models``.
DATA_EXPORTING_MODULES = frozenset(
    {
        "models",
    }
)

#: Every exported name that is neither a class nor a function, with the reason
#: it is a *domain* value rather than a transport detail. The distinction: a
#: caller either passes these to a method or compares a response field against
#: them. Anything describing how bytes reach the server — base URLs, header
#: names, timeouts, service ids, route tables, app keys — is configuration or
#: internal policy and belongs on a config field or in its own module.
#:
#: This package publishes none. Its station table, route paths, timeouts and
#: header names are all reachable through ``SrtConfig`` defaults or belong to
#: the transport, so none of them has earned a place at the root. An empty table
#: is not a weaker check than a full one: the rule below is an exact equality,
#: so the first bare value to reach ``__all__`` fails here until somebody writes
#: down why it belongs.
